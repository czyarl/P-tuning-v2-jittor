Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "output": "The main argument of this paper is that discretizing continuous prompts for natural language processing tasks has its drawbacks, as evidenced by \"wayward\" behavior that can be observed. Such behavior is especially prevalent when larger model sizes are used.

However, there are a few various measures we can take towards reducing the energy we use. The most important step is to raise awareness of the issue to people so they become motivated to take action. Beyond that, people can easily reduce their energy consumption by simple methods such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use, switching to energy efficient lighting and appliances, and unplugging electronics when not in use. Furthermore, using public transportation and carpooling instead of using one's own vehicle can make a big difference. Another way to save energy is by making use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Finally, people can use their spending power to purchase products with highly efficient energy ratings. All of these measures together can make a huge difference in reducing energy consumption and helping to save the planet. If we all take these steps now, we can find a better solution to this problem and create a brighter future."}, {"instruction": "Compose a haiku that is related to the given example", "input": "Ocean", "output": "Waves crash on the shore\nPathless journey ahead awaits\nImmense ocean blue"}, {"instruction": "Given the following text, edit it to improve grammar.", "input": "The apple was tasty, but the banana was not so yummy.", "output": "The apple was delicious, but the banana was not so tasty."}, {"instruction": "Write the code for a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum.", "input": "[1,2,3,4,5]", "output": "def sum_array(arr): \n  total = 0\n  for x in arr: \n    total += x \n  return total"}, {"instruction": "Create a shopping list for ingredients to make spaghetti carbonara.", "input": "", "output": "- spaghetti \n- bacon \n- eggs \n- Parmesan cheese \n- garlic \n- olive oil \n- salt \n- pepper"}, {"instruction": "Provide an example of how climate change might affect plants.", "input": "", "output": "Climate change could cause plants to be exposed to longer periods of drought or extreme heat, which can lead to decreased growth, increased water stress, and a higher risk of death due to lack of water."}, {"instruction": "Given the following disease, list three common symptoms.", "input": "Measles", "output": "Common symptoms of measles include a fever, runny nose, and a rash.

Furthermore, both wars led to a greater degree of cooperation between nations in the form of economic and political institutions, international agreements, and mutual defense, and in both cases, the aftermath of the war saw a dramatic increase in human displacement.\n\nHowever, there were distinct differences in the effects of the two wars. World War I saw the end of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, while World War II ended with the division of Germany into East and West.

Although self-driving cars have the potential to greatly decrease the number of accidents on the road, there are still challenges to overcome before they can be safely deployed. \nOne of the main challenges is the technology itself. Autonomous vehicles are powered by artificial intelligence, an incredibly complex computer system. For these cars to operate safely, they must be able to accurately detect and react to their environment. This requires a compute-intensive algorithm that is able to recognize and respond to signals in real-time with near perfect accuracy. Furthermore, the sensors used to detect the environment must have a very high degree of accuracy in order to prevent any misreadings. \nAnother challenge surrounds safety. Autonomous vehicles must be programmed to follow local laws and safety regulations, such as speed limits, lane markings and traffic signals. Additionally, the cars must be designed to respond and adjust in unpredictable conditions, such as bad weather. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, autonomous vehicles must be designed in such a way that a human operator can take control when needed.\n\nOther challenges include cultural, legal, and economic barriers. The idea of self-driving cars can be a hard sell to the public and the authorities, as people may feel unsafe traveling by driverless cars. Legislators can also create laws that limit the use of self-driving cars, which can be a hurdle for developers. Economically, the cost of producing autonomous vehicles is still very high, making them less accessible to consumers. \n\nIn conclusion, while autonomous vehicles have potential to revolutionize the way we travel, there are still significant challenges to overcome before they can become mainstream. Development teams must create innovative solutions to these issues in order to make the dream of self-driving cars a reality."}, {"instruction": "Give an example of a single replacement reaction.", "input": "", "output": "One example of a single replacement reaction is the synthesis of aluminum chloride in the presence of anhydrous aluminum sulfate and hydrochloric acid.

Deforestation, a process of removing forests to clear land for agricultural activities and other land uses, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that the trees can absorb, thereby increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Another human activity that contributes to climate change is the production of industrial products and burning of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To reduce climate change, individuals and businesses can reduce their emissions by making changes such as switching to renewable energy sources, using energy efficient appliances, and adopting sustainable farming practices."}, {"instruction": "Construct a query to search a database for a particular record.", "input": "Student Records", "output": "SELECT * FROM StudentRecords WHERE StudentName=\"John Smith\";"}, {"instruction": "Transform the given sentence by changing the adjectives.", "input": "She was short and slim", "output": "She was tall and curvy."}, {"instruction": "Categorize the following text into one of the genres: Comedy, Thriller, Romance, or Drama.", "input": "Two kids from very different backgrounds meet in summer camp and form an unlikely friendship.", "output": "Drama."}, {"instruction": "Create a binary classification query which determines whether a given article talks about Covid-19.", "input": "The article discusses the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy.", "output": "Does the article discuss Covid-19?

In the manufacturing industry, automated robots are now capable of accurately performing complex tasks at the same speed and quality as humans. In the healthcare sector, AI technology has enabled the development of an AI based medical support system capable of accurately diagnosing diseases and providing accurate medical advice.\n\nAs AI technology continues to become more sophisticated, our lives will change even more. AI assisted robots and drones will be used to assist in surgery and deliveries, while self-driving cars will become commonplace. AI-powered facial recognition systems will be used for authentication and security purposes. AI enabled virtual assistants will become ubiquitous, providing suggestions and advice on a variety of topics.\n\nWhile AI does provide a range of benefits, there are still risks associated with its use. AI algorithms can be hard to understand and can make decisions that are hard to predict. This can lead to biases, errors, and misuses of the technology. There is also the possibility of hacking or other malicious activities, as AI is increasingly being used to control physical systems.\n\nTo ensure that AI is used responsibly, public policies and regulations are necessary. Governments should mandate that AI developers and users work with ethical considerations in mind, and put in place measures to prevent the misuse of the technology. They should also encourage researchers and companies to take proactive steps to ensure that their AI technology is reliable, secure, and transparent.\n\nIn conclusion, AI is already well on its way to becoming a major part of our lives. It is essential that we ensure that the technology is used responsibly and for the benefit of everyone. By working together, we can ensure that AI changes our lives for the better, now and in the future."}, {"instruction": "Two of the following words do not belong in the same category.

Examples of levers can typically be seen in common items such as door handles, tweezers, and screwdrivers.\n\nA pulley is a wheel with a rope or rope-like belt that moves around it, helping to efficiently move objects up or down. The ropes or belt helps to reduce the amount of effort needed to lift the object. An example of this type of machine can be seen in clotheslines or common hang glider designs.\n\nScrews are a type of helical incline plane, which is used to hold or fasten two or more objects together. They are usually made of metal, with a threaded spiral-shaped ridge along its length. A common use of this machine is to fasten furniture to a wall.\n\nWedges can be thought of as an inclined plane attached to a solid object. The inclined plane helps to move objects by increasing its area of contact with an object, making it easier to drive in nails, split wood, or slice food.\n\nInclined planes help to reduce the amount of force needed to push or pull an object. Examples of these can be seen in ramps, stairs, and cranes.\n\nFinally, wheel and axle machines consist of a wheel connected to an axle, with the wheel having a larger radius than the axle. By turning the wheel, the axle advances by smaller steps than the wheel, making it easier to use less force to move heavy objects. Common uses include wagons, doorknobs, and vehicle steering wheels."}, {"instruction": "Construct a short story with a moral lesson", "input": "", "output": "Once upon a time, there were two best friends named John and Peter.

As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation.

Credibility is an important aspect of trust, as one must be credible to be trusted. To be credible, one has to be reliable, honest, trustworthy, and dependable. When someone is credible, they are seen as reliable, trustworthy and able to be counted on. Credibility is essential for relationships because, without it, there can be no trust.\n\nTrust in relationships relies on both parties being honest and transparent. In order for relationships to be built on a foundation of trust, a level of reliance must be established. This can be done by encouraging open communication, where both parties are honest and the boundaries are clearly defined. To build trust, it is essential for both parties to respect the boundaries, show sincerity and remain true to their word. \n\nTrust and credibility also form the cornerstone of effective leadership. A leader has to be credible and trustworthy as well as able to inspire confidence in their followers. Leaders must establish a level of trust with their constituents, so they can be able to trust in the leader and have faith in their abilities. \n\nRelationships of any kind must be built on trust and credibility, as it is what makes relationships strong and enduring. Without trust and credibility, relationships cannot thrive, as they will lack stability and will eventually disintegrate. Trust and credibility will allow relationships to stay rooted, even when the going gets tough.

Working with colleagues and bouncing ideas off each other is a part of any job, but with working from home, many employees feel detached and alone. This can lead to reduced productivity, as it can be hard to stay motivated and engaged when lonely.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of collaboration is definitely a con. Group projects and brainstorming sessions simply cannot take place in the same way when team members are physically seperated from one another. Moreover, communication over the internet can be hindered by technological issues or misunderstandings, which can lead to further delays and a lack of clarity for the work that needs to be done.\n\nIn conclusion, while working from home can provide certain benefits, it does not come without its drawbacks.

However, a liberal arts education carries numerous benefits and can give you an edge in life. A liberal arts education can provide the skills, knowledge, and experience to reach your full potential and create a successful, meaningful future. \n\nOne of the most obvious advantages of a liberal arts education is that you develop the ability to think critically and make informed decisions. In a liberal arts curriculum, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to learning; instead, you learn to think independently, analyze problems, and create solutions. This valuable experience serves you well in any career, as you are better equipped to make decisions, solve difficult problems, and understand the world around you. \n\nA liberal arts education also gives you the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics, giving you a well-rounded education. This allows you to gain a deeper understanding of a particular subject, such as history, music, art, or literature, and it can also provide insight into topics you might not otherwise pursue. As you gain exposure to different topics, you develop the ability to identify patterns, draw connections among various topics, and gain a unique perspective on the world. \n\nFinally, a liberal arts education also gives you the opportunity to work with and learn from your peers. Through discussions, debates, and constructive criticism, you are able to learn from other students with different backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives. This experience can help to broaden your worldview, improve your communication and interpersonal skills, and ultimately give you a better understanding of global issues. \n\nA liberal arts education is invaluable and should not be overshadowed by those who would suggest that it is a thing of the past. It can equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in a variety of fields and provide you with experiences that you can use throughout your life. Whether you pursue a career in the sciences, the humanities, or the arts, a liberal arts education can give you the advantage you need to reach your full potential."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite this sentence to remove ambiguity.", "input": "The girl painted with a brush in the afternoon.", "output": "The girl painted with a brush in the afternoon."}, {"instruction": "Name five unique animals and provide a short description of their appearance.", "input": "", "output": "I've chosen five unique animals, each with their own distinctive appearances:\n1.

In many countries, immigration is a necessary part of the nation\u2019s economic growth. However, there is often an associated risk of exploitation, criminal activity, and abuse of the immigration system. For these reasons, it is essential that immigration laws become more stringent.\n\nFirst and foremost, stricter immigration laws are necessary due to the potential risk of illegal immigration and the associated criminal activity. Although the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding citizens, there is always the possibility that individuals with criminal intentions will try to enter a country illegally. Without stringent regulations in place, it is easier for these individuals to go unnoticed and for their activities to go unchecked.\n\nSecond, tighter immigration policies are necessary in order to ensure that immigrants are treated fairly and that the system is not abused by individuals seeking to live off the welfare of the government\u2019s resources. Immigrants who cross the border in search of better economic opportunities should not be put at an unfair advantage, yet without thorough background checks and detailed rules, it is unfortunately difficult to ensure this.\n\nFinally, more stringent immigration laws are necessary in order to protect the country\u2019s cultural identity. This is especially true in mostly homogenous societies, which are threatened with the possibility of overcrowding and the forfeiture of traditions and values.\n\nOverall, immigration can be beneficial for a country\u2019s economic growth and overall diversity.

Many of the world's largest automakers have also responded to the change, committing to introducing more electric vehicles into their fleets. \n\nThe environmental benefits of electric vehicles are huge. By running on batteries, electric vehicles reduce emissions from traditional fossil fuel-burning vehicles significantly. To maximize these benefits, governments have begun to offer financial incentives for those interested in buying electric vehicles. Along with the environmental benefits, electric vehicles also promise improved driving performance. \n\nElectric vehicles are quickly becoming the preferred way of transport. With more and more companies investing in electric vehicles, it is clear that this technology is here to stay. We must all do our part to ensure the success of this technology, in order to ensure a sustainable and greener future."}, {"instruction": "Generate a definition for a new term: \"Digitopia\"", "input": "", "output": "Digitopia is an ecosystem that is driven by digital technologies and data to create a sustainable, high-performing, innovative, and user-friendly environment.

This group includes cats, dogs, hamsters and rabbits, all of which are soft, cuddly and full of personality. Cats and dogs are particularly popular choices for pets due to their intelligence, affection and loyalty. When shopping for a pet mammal, it is important to consider the size of the home and level of activity a pet requires.\n\nAnother type of pet animal is reptiles, such as snakes, lizards, turtles and iguanas. These pets require special needs in terms of temperature and humidity levels, and generally must be kept in aquariums or tanks with heating lights. Reptiles are cool to look at and can live longer than other pet animals, but require more resources and attention than mammals.\n\nThe final type of pet animal is birds, including parrots, finches, canaries and more. These birds are ideal for people who prefer a lower-maintenance pet since they do not need to be taken out for long walks or bathed. On the other hand, birds require open cages with plenty of room to fly and play.\n\nIn conclusion, pets are beloved companions providing unconditional love and joy. There are three primary categories of pet animals\u2014mammals, reptiles and birds\u2014each of which has unique characteristics and needs.

As temperatures and weather patterns become increasingly unpredictable, wildlife is struggling to adapt to and survive in a rapidly changing environment. From increasing floods and droughts, to the introduction of new species, climate change continues to have a devastating impact on the biodiversity of entire species across all environments.\n\nThe issues presented by climate change have been felt by a diverse array of species. Polar bears have been among the most vulnerable, as their icy habitats, which are essential for hunting and sleeping, continue to melt and shrink. Other species, such as coral, are becoming increasingly susceptible to rising ocean temperatures, leading to a form of \u201cbleaching\u201d, which can devastate entire reefs and ecosystems.   Sea levels continue to rise, while fragile aquatic habitats experience increasingly acidic waters, both which can cause immeasurable damage to delicate marine species.\n\nIn terrestrial habitats, increasing temperatures and extreme weather events are forcing animals to migrate to find more suitable habitats. As habitats shrink and become more fragmented, some species are struggling to survive due to a lack of resources and suitable nesting ground. Changes in temperature can also cause disruption to the reproductive cycles of species, leading to decreased or non-existent breeding.\n\nClimate change continues to have a tremendous impact on the population of vulnerable species around the world, and it is important to understand its implications for the long-term wellbeing of wildlife. By gaining an understanding of the effects of climate change, conservation groups and citizens can work to identify and protect habitats that may be impacted by changes in weather and temperature. In addition, changes in public policy and laws can help reduce the spread and intensity of climate change, giving wildlife a better chance of adapting and surviving in a rapidly changing world."}, {"instruction": "Formulate a marketing strategy for a new online shopping website.", "input": "", "output": "A successful marketing strategy for a new online shopping website should include the following elements: developing a unique brand identity, advertising campaigns on major social media platforms, leveraging influencers, creating targeted content, utilizing email campaigns, and offering exclusive discounts and promotional events."}, {"instruction": "Name three restaurants near Seattle.", "input": "", "output": "Three restaurants near Seattle are The Pink Door, Palace Kitchen, and Altura."}, {"instruction": "What countries speak Spanish?", "input": "", "output": "Spanish is an official language in numerous countries across the world, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Such immediacy means that more information is being shared at faster rates, which is beneficial for businesses, educational institutions, and the individual. \n\nAnother tremendous effect of the internet is its ability to bring people together and enable them to form relationships. In the past, if someone wanted to build a relationship with someone else, their only option was to meet in person. However, thanks to the internet, people have access to unlimited communication options, so they can build relationships with people from all over the world. Furthermore, the internet has opened up the possibility of connecting people who would not normally have the chance to communicate face-to-face. Finally, access to the internet has increased drastically over time, resulting in even more opportunities for connection. \n\nThe widespread availability of information is another tremendous impact of the internet. With the vast amount of data that exists on the internet, it is now much easier for people to access information on any subject. This capability is particularly beneficial for students, as digital libraries and online databases are the greatest sources of information. As digital libraries become more popular, college courses are also switching to an online format to keep up with the modern digital age.\n\nOverall, it is clear that the internet has significantly impacted the way people communicate with one another. Its vast array of applications and resources make it an invaluable asset in the modern digital age.

Physical education provides children the opportunity to learn about and participate in physical activities that have the potential to benefit them for life. These activities can help to instill positive habits such as healthy eating and exercise, while also promoting teamwork, camaraderie, and socialization.\n\nPhysical education can help children to develop healthy habits that can be beneficial to them even after they leave school. Through physical activity, children can build strength, endurance, and focus, which can lead to better academic performance. Regular exercise can also reduce behaviour problems and stress levels, while promoting good mental habits.\n\nPhysical education also helps to foster team spirit and co-operation, while giving children an appreciation for different sports and the values of fair play and sportsmanship. The physical aspect of physical education can also inspire a sense of teamwork and community, as children learn to interact and cooperate with their peers.\n\nIn conclusion, physical education is an extremely important part of a child\u2019s education. Through physical education, children not only learn about healthy habits and teamwork, but also build confidence and self-esteem.

Automation has replaced many jobs in the manufacturing and other sectors, reducing the demand for manual labor and causing job insecurity. Automation has also enabled businesses to increase productivity, optimize processes and reduce costs. Automation also requires fewer skilled workers, and this has had a particularly strong impact on blue collar workers, who traditionally held positions in industries like manufacturing. The prevalence of automation has also generated issues such as deskilling and displacement of certain types of workers. This has caused a shift in job security, with demand for higher-skilled workers with greater adaptability to new technologies. \nIn addition to negatively impacting job security, automation has also been found to decrease wages. A 2018 study by the University of Michigan found that between 1990 and 2007, the implementation of industrial robots led to a decrease in wages of up to 3%. Automation also led to an increase in inequality, as workers in industries affected by automation suffered a greater decrease in wages than those in unaffected industries.\n\nOverall, automation has had a negative impact on job security as well as wages, with a larger impact among blue collar workers. It has also caused a shift in the type of job security, as the demand has moved towards those with higher-skilled jobs and greater adaptability to new technologies. Automation has also increased inequality, as those affected by automation have suffered a greater decline in wages than those in unaffected industries."}, {"instruction": "List three books you would recommend to someone who enjoys science fiction.", "input": "", "output": "1.

The spread of the virus has caused drastic disruptions to labor markets, supply chains, and consumer spending, as well as investors\u2019 confidence in the markets. In this article, I will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and its potential long-term impacts. \n\nFirst, businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic. Many have had to close their doors due to lockdowns, and even those who remain open are struggling to cope with decreased demand and disrupted supply chains. The economic losses from COVID-19 are estimated to be anywhere from $1.2 trillion to $2.7 trillion. \n\nSecond, the labor market has also been severely impacted by the pandemic. Unemployment has skyrocketed, hitting a five-year high of more than 15%, and is predicted to continue rising in the coming months. Job losses have been especially severe for workers in the hospitality, retail, and travel industries.\n\nThird, consumer spending has declined significantly as people have been faced with reduced incomes and less access to credit. This has resulted in businesses having to increase their prices in order to stay afloat. \n\nFourth, investor confidence has been shaken by the pandemic. Stock markets around the world have seen massive losses, particularly during the initial weeks of the pandemic. Although markets have rebounded in recent months, they remain unpredictable and volatility is expected to remain high. \n\nFinally, it is important to consider the potential long-term impacts of the pandemic on the global economy. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that the pandemic could be responsible for an additional 40 million job losses, and the economic losses from COVID-19 could take several years to recover from. In addition, increased protectionism and rising tensions between the US and China could further complicate the global economic recovery. \n\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 has had an immense impact on the global economy that has been felt by businesses, workers, and investors. The full extent of the economic losses from this pandemic and the potential long-term impacts remain to be seen."}, {"instruction": "Summarize the novel 'Pride and Prejudice' in three sentences.", "input": "", "output": "Pride and Prejudice is a romantic comedy novel written by Jane Austen in 1813.

This in turn results in increased elephant-human conflict, as the animals appear close to settlements and farmland looking for food. Additionally, the demand for ivory has resulted in a significant increase in poaching, with the ivory trade being driven by illegal as well as legal activities.

Government intervention through taxes and spending can be used to help redistribute wealth, limit income inequality, and fund public services. It can also be used to provide protection to vulnerable individuals and communities, such as those affected by natural disasters, who may lack access to essential resources and services. \n\nOn the other hand, government intervention can also have negative consequences by limiting individual freedom and choice, leading to bureaucratic inefficiency, and reducing incentives for competition, innovation, and private investment. Government policies can lead to unwanted market interference, causing higher prices and disruptions of industry, and can lead to misallocation of resources and market distortions. Furthermore, the government\u2019s involvement in economic matters can lead to a lack of economic transparency which, in some cases, can be abused by those in power. \n\nOverall, government intervention in the economy should be used judiciously and thoughtfully in order to achieve both short term and long term economic stability, promote competitiveness and innovation, and ensure equity and fairness.
